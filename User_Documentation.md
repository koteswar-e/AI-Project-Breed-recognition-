# End-to-end Guess My Breed


This repository contains code to build  a Machine Learning model  which can predict the probability of Dog breed from different Dog images.

Model is trained using Keras Deep learning algorithm with terraform. 


# Why Keras Deep learning:

Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. 

It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.

# Tensorflow Usage:

TensorFlow is an open-sourced end-to-end platform, a library for multiple machine learning tasks, while Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow. 

Both provide high-level APIs used for easily building and training models, but Keras is more user-friendly because it's built-in Python.

## Instructions to Run code:

- Open the dog_vision.ipynb file in Google colab, As we have taken huge dataset it cannot be processed in Local jupyter notebooks,
 We are using googlecolob as it has the servers with High GPU.

- Load the Data sets in to the model, Which can be obtained from Kaggle
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

- Once the above steps are performed follow the instructions in Dog_breed.ipynb file and execute all the cells.
  we will get the required model predictions at the end with the prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

 
## Evaluation metrics:
  
  - The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.
